The term refers to a single line of code that, when optimized, can lead to significant cost savings in cloud infrastructure. Erik emphasizes the importance of cost optimization in cloud engineering and the need for engineers to consider cost alongside performance and functionality.\\xa0\\u200dThe conversation touches on how engineers often treat cloud resources as abundant due to the ease of provisioning, leading to wasteful spending. Erik suggests that engineers need to flip their mindset from maximizing resource consumption to optimize resource usage.\\xa0\\u200dErik runs through “million dollar lines of code” examples, such as accidentally enabling debug logging that generates excessive data, and altering data access patterns to reduce the size of API calls and lowers costs. He also highlights the importance of aligning cost optimization with a focus on delivering an excellent user experience.\\xa0\\u200dOverall, the conversation dives into the intersection of engineering decisions, cloud costs, and user experience, defining how small code changes can have a profound impact on cost savings while maintaining or even improving system performance.\\xa0\\u200dTo hear more from Erik on this subject, he will be speaking at QCon this year in San Francisco on Wednesday, October 4th.\\xa0\\u200dAbout Erik PetersonErik Peterson is the Founder and CTO of CloudZero and a pioneer in engineering-led cloud cost optimization. He has been building in the cloud since its arrival and has over two decades of software startup experience, with a passion for cost-efficient engineering and excellent margins. Erik is also a believer in Serverless computing, an AWS Ambassador, and a recovering application security survivor. He is an active contributor to the FinOps and Serverless communities and frequently shares his thoughts on cloud economics, DevOps, and security.Khawaja Shamsby Khawaja Shams, , by Khawaja Shamsby by Khawaja Shams, , Author\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKhawaja ShamsKhawaja is the CEO and Co-Founder of Momento.
